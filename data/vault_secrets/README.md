# Vault Secrets
This directory is used to (1) provide test secrets for local development and (2) create a list of expected secrets
to test production environments for operational readiness.

IMPORTANT: these files will not be used in any environment outside of local development. It is important that
DevOps add the secret to production outside the source code of this service. If you need help doing that, please
talk to your manager.
